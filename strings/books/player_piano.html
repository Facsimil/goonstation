<h1>Everything You Need To Know About The Player Piano</h1>

<hr>

<p>This book is meant to give you an idea of how to work the player piano.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>Your player piano takes raw text that you input through the interface and turns it into notes!</p>
<p>A note will play approximately every half second.</p>
<p>You can enable looping on the piano by using the piano key!</p>
<p>The piano key will also let you reset everything on the piano (like a factory reset) if something goes really crazy.</p>

<p>A "note" in the player piano has four parts, each separated by a comma:</p>

A,B,F,3

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
	<li>The Note Name</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
		<li>A, B, C, D, E, F, or G</li>
		<li>R for a silent note</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Accidentals</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
		<li>B for flat</li>
		<li>S for sharp</li>
		<li>N for natural</li>
		<li>R for a silent note</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Dynamics</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
		<li>P for piano (quietest)</li>
		<li>MP for mezzo piano</li>
		<li>N for neutral</li>
		<li>MF for mezzo forte</li>
		<li>F for forte (loudest)</li>
		<li>R for a silent note</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Octave</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
		<li>Goes from 1 to 7</li>
		<li>A0, B0, & C8 are exceptions</li>
		<li>R for a silent note</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Delay</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
		<li>Optional</li>
		<li>How long the note should rest for after playing</li>
		<li>This is <b>NOT</b> the same as note length/duration</li>
		<li>0 to play a concurrent note</li>
		<li>1 is the default</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Each note "cluster" needs to be separated by a vertical pipe, like so: A,B,F,3|B,B,F,3</p>

<p>If you want a note to be a rest, you'll need to put an R in for every field on the note (e.g. R,R,R,R)</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
	<li>You cannot change the duration of a note.</li>
	<li>If you want to play notes at the same time, you will need to link multiple pianos together. Input notes, make one piano play, and electronics will handle the rest.</li>
	<li>BE SURE TO LINK ALL PIANOS TOGETHER. IF YOU HAVE THREE, YOU WILL NEED TO LINK THE FIRST AND SECOND, SECOND AND THIRD, AND FIRST AND THIRD.</li>
	<li>You can only enter up to 1920 notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
	<li>You can use your piano's key to:</li>
	<ul style="padding: 10px;">
		<li>Activate a built in factory reset.</li>
		<li>Enable or disable the looping circuit.</li>
		<li>Set the interval of notes from 0.1 to 0.5 seconds. The default timing is 0.5 seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>You can access your piano's internal workings by prying off the front panel.</li>
	<li>You can use a multitool to reset the piano's memory once you have access to its insides.</li>
	<li>You can use a multitool to link player pianos together like you would a mechcomp component.</li>
	<li>If your linked pianos sound weird, you may have linked a set of pianos together multiple times. Use a multitool or key to reset and relink <i>carefully</i>.</li>
	<li>You can use a wirecutter to disable looping. (WARNING, THIS IS PERMANENT, DON'T LOSE YOUR DAMN KEY)</li>
	<li>You can use a screwdriver to raise and lower the wheel bolts, making the piano moveable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatic Player Piano Linking</h3>

<p>Use a multitool on a player piano with the cover removed to start storing pianos.</p>
<p>Then use it on pianos without covers that you want to link.</p>
<p>Use the multitool in your hand to start linking, each link takes 0.1 seconds.</p>
<p>4 pianos have 7 links, so it takes 0.7 seconds.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Piano's Language</h2>

<p>Your piano will often make noises. But don't worry! It's just communicating with you. And if you can't speak piano, you have this handy little book to help.</p>

<ul style="padding: 10px;">
	<li>An angry sounding beep means that the piano is busy and you can't interface with it.</li>
	<li>Whirring followed by a complete shutdown means that your note input was too long for the piano.</li>
	<li>A lot of horrible mechanical noise followed by a complete shutdown means that the tempo you tried to input was too fast or slow.</li>
	<li>Ratcheting followed by a complete shutdown means that you forgot to input a piece of a note cluster somewhere.</li>
	<li>A lot of noise followed by a count of beeps means that a note you tried to play doesn't exist. The number of beeps is the position of the note.</li>
	<li>If the song ends earlier than expected, make sure that you don't have any double vertical bars in your input.</li>
	<li>And remember, if things are funky and not working, use your piano reset key!</li>
</ul>
